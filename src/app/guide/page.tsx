            <h2>Connecting Devices</h2>
            <p>
              Before you can transfer files, you need to establish a connection between two devices. There are 
              two ways to do this:
            </p>
            
            <div className="guide-subsection">
              <h3>Method 1: Using Connection IDs</h3>
              <ol className="numbered-steps">
                <li>
                  <strong>Generate an ID:</strong> When you open TransferFiles, a unique connection ID is 
                  automatically generated for your session.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Share this ID:</strong> Copy the connection ID by clicking the "Copy" button next to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Connect on second device:</strong> On the other device, open TransferFiles and paste 
                  the connection ID into the "Enter peer ID" field, then click "Connect".
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div className="guide-tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The connection ID looks like a long string of letters and numbers. Make sure to copy and paste it exactly as shown.</p>

              <h3>Method 2: Using QR Code</h3>
              <ol className="numbered-steps">
                <li>
                  <strong>Generate QR code:</strong> A QR code is automatically displayed on the TransferFiles 
                  homepage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scan with second device:</strong> On the other device, click "Scan QR Code to Connect" 
                  and allow camera access when prompted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Point camera at QR code:</strong> Hold your device so that the camera can clearly see 
                  the QR code. The connection will be established automatically once the code is recognized.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div className="guide-tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure there's enough light for the camera to clearly see the QR code. Keep the device steady for better scanning results.</p>

            <div className="guide-subsection">
              <h3>Connection Status</h3>
              <p>
                Once a connection is established, the status indicator will change to "Connected" on both devices. 
                You're now ready to transfer files and messages.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the connection fails, you'll see an error message. See the <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>

            <div className="guide-subsection">
              <h3>Selecting Files to Send</h3>
              <p>There are two ways to select files:</p>
              <ol className="numbered-steps">
                <li>
                  <strong>Drag and drop:</strong> Simply drag files from your computer and drop them into the 
                  designated drop area on the TransferFiles interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>File browser:</strong> Click the "Choose Files" button to open your device's file browser 
                  and select one or more files.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Once files are selected, they'll appear in the file list. You can add more files or remove files 
                from the list by clicking the "Ã—" button next to each file.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="guide-subsection">
              <h3>Sending Files</h3>
              <p>
                After selecting your files, click the "Send Files" button to start the transfer. You'll see a 
                progress indicator showing the status of your transfer.
              </p>
              <div className="guide-tip">
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> For large files, make sure both devices remain connected to the internet and keep 
                  the browser tab open until the transfer is complete.

                TransferFiles supports all file types, including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.)</li>
                <li>Documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)</li>
                <li>Videos and audio files</li>
                <li>Archives (ZIP, RAR, etc.)</li>
                <li>Executables and application files</li>

              <div className="guide-tip">
                <p>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> While there's no artificial file size limit, very large files may be constrained 
                  by your browser's memory limitations. For very large files (multiple gigabytes), consider splitting them 
                  into smaller parts.

                <li>
                  <strong>No size limits:</strong> Text messages can be of any length, though very large texts may 
                  take longer to transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Instant delivery:</strong> Text messages are typically delivered immediately as they're 
                  smaller than most files.
                </li>

                <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> Text message transfer is perfect for quickly sharing code snippets, URLs,

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Download:</strong> Save the file to your device by clicking the "Download" button.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Copy images:</strong> For received images, you can copy them directly to your clipboard

              <h3>Using TransferFiles Across Networks</h3>
              <p>
                TransferFiles works across different networks and can connect devices anywhere in the world as 
                long as both have internet access. This means you can:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Transfer between office and home:</strong> Send work files from your office computer to 
                  your home device.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Share across geographical locations:</strong> Exchange files with someone in another city, 
                  country, or continent.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div className="guide-tip">
                <p>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> Very restrictive network firewalls (like those in some corporate or educational 
                  settings) might block WebRTC connections. If you're having trouble connecting, try using a different 
                  network.

              <h3>Optimizing Transfer Speed</h3>
              <p>
                To get the fastest possible transfer speeds:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Use a stable internet connection:</strong> Wired connections or strong Wi-Fi signals provide 
                  the best results.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Close unnecessary tabs and applications:</strong> This frees up system resources for the 
                  transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Compress large files:</strong> For multiple files or very large files, consider compressing 
                  them into a ZIP archive before transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Transfer fewer files at once:</strong> Instead of transferring many files simultaneously, 
                  it's sometimes faster to transfer them in smaller batches.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Security Best Practices</h3>
              <p>
                To ensure the highest level of security:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Share connection IDs securely:</strong> When sharing a connection ID, use a secure 
                  communication method to prevent unauthorized access.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Verify with the recipient:</strong> Before transferring sensitive files, verify that 
                  you're connected to the intended recipient.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Disconnect when finished:</strong> Once your transfer is complete, disconnect the session 
                  by clicking "Disconnect" or closing the tab.

              <h3>Browser-Specific Issues</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Chrome:</strong> If transfers are interrupted, check that Chrome hasn't put the tab to 
                  sleep. Pin important tabs or use extensions that prevent tab sleeping.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Firefox:</strong> If you experience connection issues, make sure Firefox's Enhanced 
                  Tracking Protection isn't blocking WebRTC connections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Safari:</strong> Ensure that Safari's privacy settings allow for WebRTC connections. In some 
                  versions, you may need to explicitly enable WebRTC in the Advanced settings.
